# Zhou_CSCI2270_FinalProject

This the final project for CSCI-2270-16

My work is crating a solving sudoko program. 

1.Solving sudoko 

I will use linked list to finish these project alone. There are no other members.

How to makefile(complile):  g++ -o sudoku main.cpp sudoku.cpp

How to run: There are two ways to use it: excute ./sudoku or cat input.txt | ./sudoku. The difference is entering a full sudoku program is complex, I will recommened you use the second ways, the input.txt is the sudoku program you want to solve
